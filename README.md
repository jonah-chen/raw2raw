# Raw2Raw Computational Photography Engine

As the name suggests, this library provide us the opportunity to perform some 
very useful computational photography techniques directly in your camera's RAW
format!

Do you want to make a long exposure but you forgot or cannot afford a ND filter?
Do you want to remove the tourists in front of a popular attraction?
Do you want to reduce the amount of noise of photos from your old camera in a
natural, non destructive way and without any of the AI nonsense?*

As a disclaimer, as of now all these methods can be done with Adobe Photoshop
(although in PSD or TIFF format rather than RAW). However, apart from just being
able to use RAW, this library is also very raw (no pun intended) which means
it will be orders of magnitude faster and memory efficient. Furthermore,
the output of this program is still a RAW file, just as if it were straight out
of the camera! So you can still use your favorite tools like Camera Raw, 
Lightroom, or your camera manufacturer's own raw processing software to keep
editing them, without any loss.

*you do want a tripod for most of these methods
